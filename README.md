# Atheena/Apollo's site of links and tools
> *This is just a site for me to list tools and sites I use a lot. Mostly for me, but also for others!*

## Tools
My favorite proxy: 20.81.62.32:3128
> Why? I like it because it is HTTPS AND HTTP, which is cool. It is also anonymous B)

My favorite sites for programming: replit.com, jsfiddle.com, w3schools.com, stackoverflow.com
> Why? Replit is good for whole projects. Like Programs, and this is also because of Nix! JSFiddle is good for code snippets. W3 Schools is useful for learning new things. Stack Overflow is best for errors.

## Cool stuff
The Useless Web (theuslessweb.com) is a site that picks a random site from a list. It is funny as hell. Faves: puginarug.com, eelslap.com

Meme Generator (imgflip.com/ai-meme) is funny. Sometimes it makes sense, sometimes not.

InspiroBot (inspirobot.me) makes motivational quotes. This doesn't make any sense.

WaifuLabs (waifulabs.com/generate) is cool. It generates a square image of a anime girl based on input. This is good for anime profile pictures that you dont want to steal art!

This Person Does Not Exist (thispersondoesnotexist.com) is a image generator that generates images of people that don't exist. This site is almost creepy because they look so real. You know they are fake, so it makes it uncanny, even though the images are too real to actually be uncanny.
